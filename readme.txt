Revolutionize your WordPress development with our innovative plugin role-based CSS customization feature. Seamlessly customize both the public frontend and admin backend (wp-admin) using a single CSS file, intelligently tailored to different user roles.

This powerful tool empowers developers to create unique style combinations for each user role, ensuring a personalized experience for administrators, editors, authors, contributors, subscribers, and even visitors/guests.
